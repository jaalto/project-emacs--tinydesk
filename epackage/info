Description: save and restore files between sessions
 Simple desktop save and restory command. Only filenames and directories
 are read/saved. Unlike the other desktop savers, this one can unload files
 from Emacs. You just tell it to remove 'these files listed in file
 state.XXX', and those files will be removed. You can use this fature to
 collect 'projects' and switch between them easily. After project1, unload
 it and load project2 for editing. Parses any file that includes filenames
 and comments. In regular intervals saves the state of Emacs. If Emacs
 crashes you can recover the previous session.
 .
 Later Emacs versions introduced "~/.saves*" files that I found disturbing
 occupying the home directory. With this package all the files are put into
 one state state file, which can be reused.
