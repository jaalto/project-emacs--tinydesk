               NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE

            This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
            please see "t2html.pl --help" for option --script-file
            to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

            XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
            It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
            element and attribute names

            This default CSS2 has been validated according to
            http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

            Comments on the CSS tags:

            -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

            NETSCAPE 4.05

            -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
               font size changes does not show up in screen.
            -  :hover property is not recognised

            NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

            -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
               (IE has no trouble to show it)

            MSIE 4.0+

            - Renders CSS very well.

            Media types

            - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
              the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
              or media "screen"
            - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
              to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
              just define P.column7 { ... }

            The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
            I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

            So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
            (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
            which means both print and scree types.)

                @media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

            To work around that, we separate the definitions with

                P.code { .. }               // For screen

                @media print { P.code      // for printer
                {
                    ..
                }}

            And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

<P class="column8">
        This document is the manual for PGP handling package
        TinyPgp.el, software that runs in Unix Emacs 19.30+/20+;
        XEmacs 19.15+/20+ and WinNT EMacs 20.3+


<P class="column8">
        Emacs version 20+ or XEmacs 20+ is required
        for PGP 5.0 support. This is due to additional package
        expect.el by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen (Author of Gnus), which
        uses new backquote syntax. The package does not work in older
        Emacs.


<P class="column8">
        For PGP 2.6.x any decent 19.x or higher Emacs version will do.


<P class="column8">
        The mail agents supported are MH, VM, RMAIL and GNUS. In
        addition, there is direct interface to Emacs mime packages
        TM, SEMI and to BBDB email database package.


<P class="column8">
        TinyPgp is intended to be a 2nd generation Emacs PGP interface and
        it supports all major pgp commands from inside emacs. Remailing
        and anonymous account handling in different servers are included.


<P class="column8">
        From this document you'll find the basic instructions and some
        common asnwers to the spcific problems. You still have to read the
        full source code if you want to modify package to your special
        needs. This document doesn't explain <EM class="word">all</EM> variables used in the
        package one by one, but only discusses the major topics: how you
        use configure package for every day use.

<P class="column10"><EM class="quote10">
          <STRONG class="word">TinyPgp</STRONG> project is currently under low priority due to high
          load in my current everyday work projects. There won't be active
          development on-going until the end of 1999. Especially the
          <STRONG class="word">TM</STRONG> and <STRONG class="word">SEMI</STRONG> PGP/MIME interfaces won't work preperly in the
          current version. (they used to, but SEMI, GNUS etc phased so
          fast forward that I haven't have time to keep up with them)</EM>



<P class="column8">
        Releases up to <EM class="word">1.307</EM> were pgp 2.6.2 only and releass on 2.x tree
        take steps towards PGP 5 and NT Emacs.


<P class="column8">
        Some seldom used functions don't work yet: like pubring generate,
        key generate and some functions are planned, like keys' <EM class="word">trust</EM>
        parameter handling and complete key handling mode. These are of low
        priority in my list, because I'm first concentrating on a) basic
        PGP b) the remailing and everything else comes after that.

      1.8 Preface
      
  </H2>




        TinyPgp offers you an easy PGP handling and supports PGP/MIME
        if Emacs packages SEMI or TM is available.


<P class="column8">
        TinyPgp's approach is to build as easy an interface as possible
        to the PGP world, including remailing and easy anonymous account
        handling. Ideally everything should run almost unnoticed to you.


<P class="column8">
        The emphasised areas are also on easy key management and complex
        pubring handling: that is a way you can prevent your keyring from
        blowing up. It also means that you can control how you want to
        classify your keys (different keyrings for different mailing
        lists). The big pubrings are rumored to be supported by some later
        pgp release, but if you use big pubrings now, pgp gets a tad slow.
        That's why there is currently an emphasis on smaller pubrings. (PGP
        2.6.x mostly, I don't know how PGP 5 performs).

        TinyPgp is included in the standard Tiny Tools release under
        emacs-lisp/ directory If there are several in the N.NNN tar
        files in the directory, download only the latest. The TinyPgp
        kit contains all you need for BBDB/TM/SEMI. Just plug it and
        don't worry about the installation.


<P class="column10"><EM class="quote10">
          TinyPgp should work right out of the box and automatically
          configure itself to our mail agent you use: RMAIL; VM or GNUS. If

          for the first time, the message should be clear enough to

          <EM class="word">Messages</EM> buffer in Emacs and &quot; <EM class="word">Message-Log</EM>&quot; buffer in XEmacs

        In order to catch up with bugs fast and reliably, please follow
        these instaructions. Install also two additional packages and read the
        documentation carefully. Detailed instructions are in the start of
        each file.

<UL>
	<LI><EM class="word">tinymail.el</EM> : See to the end of file and copy the example
            setup where the additional X-info field is automatically sent
            to me. I need your tiny tools configuration whenever you speak
            with me. Test that the X-info appears when you write mail to my
            address and you know you have got the packae configured right.
            This saves lot of time and I don't have to guess your setup if
            you're sending a bug report.
	<LI><EM class="word">tinydiff.el</EM> : You will be receiving corrections in patch
            format if you report any problem and I correct them. This
            package needs no special installation, you just bind function
            <SAMP class="word">tdi-patch</SAMP> to some convenient key. When you receive patch, you
            just call this function and the fix is put in place, you don't
            even have to specify path or patch options, it all happens
            automatically. Alternatively you can use Standard emacs package
            <EM class="word">ediff.el</EM>.
	<LI><EM class="word">tinylisp.el</EM> : This will help you to debug all the lisp
            problems with convenient echo-area interface. You will be
	            able to debug lisp fucntions with <EM class="word">edebug.el</EM> with few commands.
</UL>




<P class="column8">
        If you can't get <EM class="word">tinymail.el</EM> running and sending me your library
        installation info, please don't install TinyPgp yet. We have to
        solve your problems with that package first.

        You can adjust the forget time so that it is comfortable to you:

        protection)

        When emacs is locked, there is no way to unlock it without the right
        password. If you forget the password, you have to kill

        To grab this pass phrase, 'test me', can be done by anyone who know
        how to write C-program to access all command line options found
        from ps(1) listing. All they have to do is to find &quot;-z&quot; somewhere
        in the started process environment cmd flags that's it: you're
        busted and your security is gone.


<P class="column8">
        TinyPgp does not have this security leak because it doesn't use
        the -z option by default. The alternative way is presented in
        pgp.faq where Patrick J. LoPresti advises to use &quot;...funky shell
        redirection to make PGP pgp get the pass phrase from an
        arbitrary file. &quot;. The suggested PGPPASSFD is used here so that
        you get maximum security when communicating with Pgp.

        Repeat: no one can see the pass phrase by looking ps(1) listing if
        you use TinyPgp in Unix with following variable set to non-nil

        TinyPgp communicates with Pgp over several files. This is a design
        decision and it can't be changed. Some Pgp implementations try to
        use pipes as much as possible, but because current Pgp is not
        designed to work like Unix pipes, I chose the file approach. There
        are some benefits of this:

<UL>
	<LI>files are easily managed
	<LI>files are easily debugged, when TinyPgp fails to work correctly
</UL>




<P class="column8">
        But it also means that the files can be snooped by super
        user. Normally you should be safe because the file permissions used
        by TinyPgp are very strict and files used are immediately removed
        when they are no longer needed, Monitoring your files is a bit
        difficult. Bear in mind that your secring.pgp can also read by
        super user (disks are also backup'd regularly to tapes for a ong
        time)

        Currently the supported mail agents are VM and RMAIL. The labeling
        works this way: when you call pgp command over message, the correct
        label is attached to it. Eg. if you received PGP signed message
        and you hit C-c / v to verify it, the label added would be

      4.6 Signing: What headers to sign.
      
  </H2>




        It is very important that you carefully choose what headers are
        signed. Do not just add bunch of headers, because you must consider
        if the receiving end gets the same headers <EM class="word">unmodified</EM>. If the
        heders' values have been changed during the transit in network, the
        receiving end can't verify the message, because those headers don't
        have the original text any more.


<P class="column8">
        The thumb rule: Sign as few headers as possibly, so that the
        signing count keeps small and the chance of modified headers is
        minimal. The purpose of signing headers is that it protects the key
        headers from tampering; those which are crucial to your message.


<P class="column8">
        You can sign any headers as you like, but please consider these

      4.12 Keyserver: various ways to get PGP public keys
      
  </H2>




        There are several methods in the program how you can request a
        public key if you don't have it already. The design guideline of
        the program was that no keys are fetched without person first
        asking for it. So, if you want to send someone encrypted mail (you
        should if they use pgp), then there are three basic ways to get the
        public key.

        The key servers are the most reliable way to find a key, but they
        may be so loaded that getting a key may takes several minutes. I
        usually start by finger a person and only if it fails, I call the
        key server. If the person doesn't have key in his ~/.plan file, I
        usually mention about that in the message to him.


<P class="column8">
        The email interface is almost the same as key server fetching, but
        as the name says, the key is requested via email and is only
        available to you when you get mail back.

        When you have finally created your public key and you want to put
        it publically available, you send it to keyserver. You are also
        recommended to put it into your ~/.plan file which is read by
        'finger' process.

        Sending your key to <STRONG class="word">one</STRONG> server is enough. After it processes your
        key, it will forward your add request to other servers

        because you should keep &quot;primary&quot; ring as small as possible due to
        speed. If pubring is big, calling Pgp is slow.


<P class="column8">
        The <EM class="word">primary</EM> pubring is the one that contains you closest friends
        whom you talk with pgp often. The occasional friends that you meet
        in the internet should be left in the <EM class="word">secondary</EM> pubrings.

        Package's basic design thrives to multiple pubrings. I normally
        talk to different people and I miss the feature from Pgp to attach
        'label' to fetched key. Storing keys to keyrings that have been
        named according to subject areas, I can remember who the person
        was. I have selected prefix <EM class="word">pr-</EM> for all my other pubrings.

<P class="column8">
        When I mail someone, who uses pgp, and I don't have his pgp public
        key, the first thing I do, is to decide where I store this person's
        pgp key. If I respond to someone whom i probably never meet again
        (casual newsgroup message), I fetch the key and store it to pubring
        <EM class="word">junk</EM>. I mail the message, encrypt it with the key and forget that
        user never existed.


<P class="column8">
        This way I don't keep stacking pile of unneeded keys into my other
        vital keyrings. Also, using multiple keyrings let you categorise
        people with whom you talk to. If all the keys were in one pubring,
        how should I know where Mr. xxx xx@doodle.com's key come from? When
        it is in pubring <EM class="word">elisp</EM> I know &quot;Aha, he's Emacs lisp package
        developer.&quot;  Using multiple pubring acts like <EM class="word">labelling</EM> the keys.


<P class="column8">
        There is one problem: if you want to send mail to several people
        and encrypt the message, all the keys must be in the same
        pubring. For those purposes you probably want to merge all pubrings
        together to create <EM class="word">big</EM> pubring which you can use when sending
        encrypted mail to several people.


<P class="column8">
        See this variable how you should control the several pubrings. The
        primary pubring must be put first in the list and the big, merged,
        pubring must be last in the list. Variable's documentation string
        will explain the usage in full.

        If you want to have maximum security, you should keep your
        secring.pgp in encrypted format. If you're in multi-user envronment
        like Unix, be aware that the sysadms make backups of the disks in
        regular intervals and your secring.pgp gets stored somewhere in
        their tapes. Anyone that can access those tapes can read your
        secring contents. And even if you're in single user environment,
        somebody may sit down your console while you're away and copy the
        secring.pgp. Also imagine what happens if the whole computer gets
        stolen (typically a PC)


<P class="column8">
        secring.pgp contains your secret keys and key-id's that you
        have created for your private use. Why should you encrypt your
        secret keyring? The snooper cannot use those keys because he doesn't
        have the pass phrases, right? Yes, the keys cannot be used, but
        he can look what keys you have generated and reveal you <EM class="word">newnym</EM>

        You should get on hand the remailer faqs and the help files, so
        that you understand what's happening when you start using the
        remailer functions. I have tried my best to make all this as
        transparent as possible, but unless you have a clue how remailer
        messages are constructed, please don't try to use the remailer
        interface at all. It is also essential that you realize not to use
        remailing to harrash people. If you do so, you will be sure that
        any decent remailer admin tries his best to track you down, in
        spite of your anonymity, and draw your account.


<P class="column8">
        The remailers are good thing, as pgp itself, but if you misuse them
        they may eventually vanish due to abuse. For this reason you are
        not allowed to remail to multiple recipients. TinyPgp will not
        support bulk anonymous messages.

      5.3 Reply block: do you need it?
      
  </H2>




        To be honest, you don't necessary need a reply block if you want to
        use the remail/anonymizing interface to <EM class="word">send</EM> messages. The reply
        block is needed for couple of reasons:

<UL>
	<LI>You use reply block to test your remailer chain. The
            block should return back if the chain is alive. If you
            don't get the reply block back, then you shouldn't use
            that remailer chain (the chain may be only one remailer)
	<LI>If you send anonymous message to someone and you include
            your reply block(that's encrypted), the person is able to
            answer to you. He simply send the message back to the remailer
            whose reply block that is and you'll get his answer.
            Naturally anonymized by the remailer.
	<LI>You have to submit reply block to <EM class="word">Newnym</EM> type accounts.

        To test remailers, you usually need to construct <EM class="word">reply</EM> <EM class="word">block</EM>.
        The block is smallest piece of encrypted text that tells to send
        the message back to you.

        Do not distribute your public key by mail or Usenet post, because
        there are more proper ways. People generally do not want that 'you'
        send the key to them, instead they want to get it by thenself from
        some trusted channel: finger or key server. The reason for this
        should be obvious: email is not a secure channel, anyone can
        replace the contents of your mail with something other.


<P class="column8">
        Use some/all of the ways here to make your public key available:

<UL>
	<LI>Put it in your ~/.plan file, so people can simply finger
            you for it. Open the ~/.plan file and just insert key there.
	            This doesn't work if your site does not allow fingering.

	<LI>Post it to a public-key server which in turn automatically
            distributes your key to all the other keyservers.  This is the

      9.2 Development note: Using comint to talk to PGP interacively
      
  </H2>




        Some PGP commands can't be run in batch mode, so we need a live
        shell process inside emacs and through which we talk to PGP. The
        comint code used may cause troubles, because there is no good
        watchdog in the code to determine when PGP has finished outputting
        text and stopped asking for some new input. For now, the comint
        code is mainly experimental and I haven't decided if I continue
        developing it.


<P class="column8">
        One command that uses comint is 'Conventional crypting'.  This
        feature may be handy if you send some big file (tar, binary): you
        can use the conventional crypting solely for UU. Use some common
        keyword like <EM class="word">test</EM> and tell in the mail message:

<P class="column8">
        PGP's own UUencode method <EM class="word">base64</EM> is not necessarily the best,
        because it splits the big file into small UU chunks...with crypt
        you can UU the whole file to one chunk

        To decypt this conventionally crypted ascii armor is no different
        than normal decrypting. Use M-x tinypgp-decrypt-region.

        This means that PGP needs to regenerate file ~/.pgp/randseed.bin or
        some similar file. To do so, you'd encrypt some dummy file to get
        the PGP to generate the randseed.bin file again. Please switch to

        versions, because no version dependent code is used.


<P class="column8">
        XEmacs support is only secondary, but I don't expect many problems
        when I start looking more into it, because I use compatibility
        functions from my libs that take care of XEmacs specific things.


<P class="column8">
        Windows95 support is not considered, mostly because it doesn't
        allow multiple comint processes that are needed here in some
        circumstances. If I have time, maybe, I can see if I can disable
        the parts of the code that uses interactive comint buffer when the
        environment is PC-based.

        Were you already running gnus when you loaded TinyPgp? The package

        And this is probably the problem. You have to kill the article

        When you decrypt a message in RMAIL buffer, the read-only property
        must be turned off by entering <EM class="word">rmail-edit-mode</EM> before the

        complete its task, the buffer is left in <SAMP class="word">rmail-edit-mode</SAMP>.


<P class="column8">
        Be sure to press <SAMP class="word">C-c</SAMP> <SAMP class="word">C-c</SAMP> to end the <SAMP class="word">rmail-edit-mode</SAMP> before
        you continue using the RMAIL or you may accidentally modify the
        message's content.


<P class="column8">
        In normal situation the rmail-edit mode is temporarily turned on,
        encryption done, and edit mode closed, so you normally see only

        ...I thought about multiple keyrings but this breaks down the
        web-of-trust. The only way I see this working is if the keyring
        contains only keys that are within the user's web-of-trust.

<P class="column8">
        ...The problem I have had with keyring indexing is that everything
        in PGP is so interlocked. I have to use the crypto side of PGP to
        sign/revoke/generate a key. When this is done I have to reindex. I
        can work with the addition/removal of keys from within an external
        program, but the crypto stuff that happens cannot happen through
        external means.


<P class="column8">
        This still begs the question of utilizing a key from a very large
        keyring to encrypt a file. PGP still has to go through this large
        keyring to find it and then utilize it. This is why I am looking at
        integrating the indexing somehow so that PGP just has to call the
        index procedure to get the file pointer. This is where the
        bottleneck exists in PGP.
