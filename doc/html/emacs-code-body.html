               NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE

            This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
            please see "t2html.pl --help" for option --script-file
            to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

            XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
            It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
            element and attribute names

            This default CSS2 has been validated according to
            http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

            To design colors, visit:

            Comments on the CSS tags:

            -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

            NETSCAPE 4.05

            -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
               font size changes does not show up in screen.
            -  :hover property is not recognised

            NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

            -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
               (IE has no trouble to show it)

            MSIE 4.0+

            - Renders CSS very well.

            Media types

            - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
              the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
              or media "screen"
            - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
              to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
              just define P.column7 { ... }

            The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
            I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

            So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
            (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
            which means both print and scree types.)

                @media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

            To work around that, we separate the definitions with

                P.code { .. }               // For screen

                @media print { P.code      // for printer
                {
                    ..
                }}

            And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

        This document contains Unix Emacs Lisp programming information. It
        addresses the coding style of Emacs lisp and also presents notes
        about Emacs lisp byte compiler. Emacs Lisp code profiling is also

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        This document won't introduce you to lisp, you must have basic
        knowledge about lisp programming beforehand: functions, local,
        global variables and various forms used in lisp. Mainly, this
        contains no ready solutions, functions, that you could use. There
        may be case studies though.

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        This document contains some guidelines that were found handy. There
        have also appeared also very good articles in the Usenet Emacs
        newsgroups and many good articles may have passed by, but hope you
        find those included interesting. It is recommended that you first
        read some elementary lisp reference before reading this paper.


<p class="column8">
        Read this document as recommendations, not as strict rules. Adapt
        ideas that seem reasonable to you, and discard the others you feel,
        don't serve your needs.


<p class="column8">
        The <samp class="word">Elp</samp> (lisp profiling tool) results in the page are
        mainly for curious reader, when he needs some reference how to
        write tight loops, time critical functions. But normally there is
        not much need for optimization in Emacs: you run into performance
        problems very rarely. Be very skeptical when reading the results
        and do not put your blind trust on them.

        Someone else reading your code will appreciate any extra
        explanation that you may have written. Someday the code may also be
        maintained by someone else than you, so bear in mind that the
        would-be-maintainer can take over your code, when you no longer are
        around.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Maintenance and readability comes first, never write tight
        code. Functions are easier to read if they are &quot;airy&quot;
        instead. Your code doesn't run any faster, no matter how
        much you shrink it. Some people like to delete all white spaces
        from their functions so that the code lines are stuck together;
        but that is not necessarily the best practice.


<p class="column8">
        Organize parts that belong together, into groups and add dashes or
        anything to make it visible that something important is happening
        (function or condition)

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Don't be afraid of using many variables. Especially in functions,
        that need local variables. A variable can &quot;self document&quot; the code
        if named properly. Use XEmacs byte compiler to check is you have
        defined variables that you haven't actually used, so that the byte
        compilation results are clean. (<strong class="word">Note:</strong> The XEmacs byte compiler
        can better catch programming errors than Emacs byte compiler.)


<p class="column8">
        In most cases the possible minor performance penalty of using many
        variables doesn't matter. See the profiling results later in this
        document.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Document your variables and functions well. If functions sets
        globals, say it in the docs (use &quot;References:&quot; tag). Every function
        and variable should have DOC-STRING, because when you do
        <samp class="word">describe-symbols</samp>, it'll print out the SYMBOL and DOC-STRING. And
        one can even search through the doc strings with <samp class="word">super-apropos</samp>
        Don't forget that the first line of the doc string should be a
        complete sentence.

<p class="column8">
        Now you have to skim the code to understand how and where the
        variable is used. The original Emacs recommendation has been that
        you do need to document package private variables, like the one
        above. However this recommendation is old and dates back to 18.xx
        days where the doc-strings memory space was a limited resource. In
        new Emacs releases there is dynamic byte compilation option which
        reduces the docstring memory consumption. There is no need to &quot;hand
        optimise&quot; the doc-strings away.

        Think about new comers when you program, who know nothing about
        lisp. Try to code clearly. Avoid tricks, which is not very frienly

        that point looks so complex.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Use <samp class="word">error</samp> command if you cannot continue, or if you think that
        some other program may depend on your code, it is best that the
        other program cannot continue. Don't try unnecerrarily handle
        erorr conditions - it won't work in general with Emacs Lisp,
        like if you have got used to Java's or C++'s <samp class="word">throw</samp> staements.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        But not so general that it can eat apples and cars. It's &quot;good&quot;,
        when the function doesn't get excessive long: still long <samp class="word">cond</samp>
        statements are ok. Sometimes you just can't split the task into
        smaller parts or it makes no sense to split the function, oh
        well...use your best judgement.


<p class="column8">
        Still, a long function raises always thoughts about bad coding.
        Usually there may be reusable parts, which can be separated, but
        then, perhaps no. Just make sure you are convinced you need that
        long function, and that's it.

  <h2>
      3.2 Let with initialised empty values

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Let's start with example code:

<P>
<TABLE class="shade-normal">
    <TR>
    <TD class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <PRE>
      (let* ((foo '())    ;; A list
             (bar nil)    ;; A truth value
             test)        ;; A scratch variable.    </PRE></TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>


<p class="column8">
        This effectively causes <em class="word">foo</em>, <em class="word">bar</em>, <em class="word">test</em> to be <em class="word">nil</em>. Don't
        give the extra stuff fool you. The programmers intention was to
        clarify, that the foo is a <strong class="word">list</strong> and by initialising it with ()
        would signify a list context... and so on..


<p class="column8">
        But it can be done it more cleanly. The more symbols there are in
        the view, the less easily can human eye focus to important things.
        Let's try this instead:

<P>
<TABLE class="shade-normal">

             test)        ;; A scratch variable.    </PRE></TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>


<p class="column8">
        In this case, the variable <em class="word">names</em> itself tell where they
        are used, and the missing symbols greatly improve the layout. You
        know, that variable is nil by default, so there is no point of
        assigning an empty list. Less is more, in most cases. In addition,
        when you use these variables inside function body, it's clear all
        the time what that stand for because the names tell them.

<p class="column8">
        Because you will be using globals a lot in Emacs lisp packages,
        couple of words may be in place You probably are shocked by the
        fact that lisp programs use globals (actually prefixed or namespace
        globals) all the time, when you have learned that using globals is
        totally wrong and should be avoided at any costs.


<p class="column8">
        The class variables behave quite alike to global variables
        especially if the class derivation chain is long. Hm, to be strict,
        the scope of the variable just gets larger.

<p class="column8">
        <samp class="word">var1</samp> is not real global, because it ceases to exist if the class
        is deleted. But, When you see code like this, where variable is
        &quot;seen&quot; outside of function, the instincts say that we should treat
        <em class="word">var1</em> like global. It's temptating to think that local is
        something that is inside function or function block, and variables
        outside of a function, while they may be actually packaged within
        class, are all &quot;globals&quot;. Admittedly this is not very accurate
        distinction, but a practical point of view. In Emacs lisp, the
        variable <em class="word">scope</em> is whole package and the variables are <em class="word">true</em>
        globals because any other packages can see them too.


<p class="column8">
        In Emacs Lisp you can also abstract the use of globals with the
        degree you want:

<ul>
	<li>You can use globals directly
<li>Indirectly in functions: using the aliasing method described
            in a short moment.
	</li>
<li>Using control functions; that hide the globals from
	            functions (quite strong abstraction)</li>

<p>
<p class="column8">
        To clarify: the term aliasing used in next sections doesn't
        mean real aliasing. The variable is not actually referred
        through an alias. When you work with a <em class="word">alias</em> variable, you can
        pretend that you actually work with the global variable. The alias
        term is used merely for purposes where you <em class="word">read</em> the global when
        you use it in function. You do not <em class="word">write</em> to a variable
        aliased like this. We're actually using a copy of variable.


<p class="column8">
        The next sections will describe these benefits better, but the
        advantages of copying the global variables are listed here for
        quick reference:

<ul>
	<li>When globals are only in <em class="word">let</em>, you can see at one glance
            what globals are used in the function. If your function has
            10-20 lines, you can't find the used globals that easily
<li>You can add extra comment for each global while it
            is being aliased in <samp class="word">let</samp>.
	</li>
<li>Function maintenance is simpler: you can lift the global
            from <em class="word">let</em> to the argument list of a function without
            touching the function body. You do this if you decide
            that the argument should be passed to function and not
	            read from global.</li>

        If any global variables is used in a function, don't use

        you just lift the value from let-form to the parameter list, and

        Hm. What do you think? I'd say that this is equal to mine what
        comes to lisp. But by using the same name in function argument list
        as for global variable, may makes things confusing, because
        <samp class="word">my-mode-alist</samp> is originally meant to be global variable and used
        in other functions directly. The key point here was that we
        intended to make function more general, implying that we are
        probably moving it away from this <em class="word">my-mode</em> package and including
        it into some general lisp library. If we move this function in #2a
        format, we wouldn't want to keep symbol names(variables), which
        refer to specific package <em class="word">my-mode</em>.


<p class="column8">
        Detecting reusable functions from any package is easier if the
        globals are presented in the first let statement.

<p class="column8">
        Hm, yes and no; program won't slow down remarkably by the extra
        <samp class="word">let*</samp> statement. More important is the ease of maintenance and
        ability to add comments beside the let statement, since all
        variables may not be self explanatory. If function
        is very <em class="word">small</em>, use could those global variables directly to gain

<p class="column8">

        Nowadays many books and many programmers teach that you should
        define variables inside block where you need them. This is
        perfectly good suggestion and you should follow it in natively
        compiled languages. The advise for Emacs Lisp is: &quot;use when
        appropriate&quot;.


<p class="column8">
        <em class="word">Note:</em> There is slight difference in memory usage if you define a)
        all variables at the beginning of function b) along the execution
        of your program, where they are created and destroyed. While the A
        may take couple of bytes overall more memory, the important point
        is the content of the variables. If you put 100 cons cells
        immediately into the variable, that's hogging memory, not the
        variable definition itself.


<p class="column8">
        In practice don't worry about this minor memory increase,
        because creating and destroying a variable increases overhead for
        functions too (multiple let statements), so how do you choose: a
        small memory increase at the beginning of file where you define all
        my variables or do you take chance on adding a slight overhead by
        defining variables while the function executes? In big, complex
        function this could be very important issue, but in short functions
        the choice is insignificant.


<p class="column8">
        Most of the time you can use only one <samp class="word">let*</samp> because it helps

        standing blocks by using many let statements and introduce new let

        Before going further, remember that all lisp forms return the last
        value which the form executed prior its ending. This is fundament
        of lisp language and whole lisp programming is based on it. The key
        here is that you can make the function's return value more visible:
        the point where the return value is set is obvious.  If we use
        extra variable, say <em class="word">ret</em>, over the implicit return value, the
        function is a) easier to debug: you can print the <em class="word">ret</em> variable
        anywhere b) easier to follow: setting the return value is obvious
        3) and one exit point is better than &quot;hidden&quot;.


<p class="column10"><em class="quote10">
          Of course if the function is <em class="word">very</em> <em class="word">small</em> or extremely simple,
          you don't have use 'ret': return value is already obvious. Use
          your common sense to determine when the extra return variable
          <em class="word">ret</em> could clarify the function and when you decide to leave it
          out and use lisp form's side effects of returning value of
          last executed statement.</em>

        How should message displaying be controlled in good manner?  If you

        eg. if it does some file handling and it may be a good idea to
        print some messages to the user about the progress stages.

        There are couple of interesting points in this solution. First, it
        provides verbosity to the user. Second it provides verbosity to the
        <em class="word">caller</em> too. The idea is, that by default the function is verbose
        when user calls it, but it also gives the verbose messages whenever
        someone else calls it..


<p class="column8">
        The function can now be called like this and it keeps the used
        nicely aware of progress:

        But the functions is recalled with the command with <samp class="word">C-x</samp> <samp class="word">ESC</samp>
        <samp class="word">ESC</samp> followed by re-run with <samp class="word">RET</samp>, the verbose messages are
        nnot printed.


<p class="column8">
        This actualy makes user function easier to call, because
        you don't have to call them via <samp class="word">M-x</samp> (or key binding) to get the
        verbose messages (like returning status, state of mode on/off).
        Developers can now turn on particular verbosity of some function if
        they think would be good to display messages to the user while
        function is executing.

        packages that may use the advised function.


<p class="column8">
        This is much better way than previously presented
        <samp class="word">eval-after-load</samp> method. This time you need <em class="word">advice.el</em> from
        standard emacs distribution. Why is this better? Because
        advice doesn't wipe out functions permanently, you can turn
        them on and off when needed.


<p class="column8">
        The advice has flag <em class="word">around</em> that lets you do things around then
        function: before and after calling it. But if you don't call
        <samp class="word">ad-do-it</samp> inside advice, then you have effectively replaced the
        function. This is what you need

<p class="column8">
        Macros are (probably) the most difficult thing in LISP to
        understand, especially coming from a background in C or assembly.
        The big key in lisp is that a macro is just a function invoked by
        the evaluator to find out what it should really evaluate. This has
        two big implications:

<ul>
	<li>Arguments to a macro are not evaluated.
	<li>Macros can call functions</li>
</ul>




<p class="column8">
        It is not necessary (and because of feature #1, somewhat brain
        twisting) to call a macro from another macro.


<p class="column8">
        When you write a macro, don't think of it as writing a macro, but
        as a function that will be called to translate the arguments (as
        you've specified) from the way they are to some other form. Your
        return value is the form to be executed instead.


<p class="column8">
        For example:

<P>
<TABLE class="shade-normal">
    <TR>
    <TD class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <PRE>
      (defmacro my-setq (var value)
        (list 'setq var value))

      (macroexpand '(my-setq x y))
      ==&gt;(setq x y)

      (defmacro msf (symbol)
        `(symbol-function (quote ,symbol)))    </PRE></TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>


<p class="column8">
        But is a bit less obvious.


<p class="column8">
        If you really want to hurt your brain, think about situation where
        you might want to do ',',form (which is valid code and I've seen it
        used, but never had to use it myself). You do this kind of thing
        when you write macros which produce other macros.

      9.2 A note on lisp and &quot;forward declarations&quot;
      
  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column10"><em class="quote10">
          Dewey M. Sasser <EM><a href="mailto:dewey@newvision.com" >dewey@newvision.com</A></EM></em>



<p class="column8">
        Lisp does not have &quot;forward declarations&quot;, as in some other
        languages. In using Lisp, you should make sure that the definition
        has been seen before it is used.


<p class="column8">
        If you define function A using function B, but before function B
        has been defined, it will work, but the byte compiler may not be
        able to check your call to function B. Also, if B is really a macro
        rather than a function, it's definition <em class="word">must</em> have been seen
        before it is used. Remember that macros are expanded by the
        byte-compiler and do not actually get compiled into your code. Only
        the results are compiled in.


<p class="column8">
        Anyone who programs in Lisp a lot (and you definitely do) should
        have a copy of <strong class="word">Common</strong>Lisp:_the_Language_, 2nd Edition, by Guy L.
        Steel. Emacs Lisp is not strictly compatible with the language it
        defines, but Steel's book (commonly referred to as CLtL2) is a very
        good reference and description of how and while. It's not a
        tutorial, but an annotated standard.


<p class="column8">
        Whenever possible, have your macros expand to normal lisp code, the
        way you'd write it if you weren't using macros. Since you wouldn't
        write a normal function like:

<P>
<TABLE class="shade-normal">
    <TR>
    <TD class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <PRE>
      (setf (symbol-function 'my-func)
              (function (lambda (x) (do-something x))))    </PRE></TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>


<p class="column8">
        don't make your macro expand to that unless there's some very good
        reason. If you go look at my modefn.el, where
        <samp class="word">modefn::define-mode-specific-function</samp> does the real work behind a
        &quot;defmodemethod&quot; call, you'll see that what it's doing is just
        building the proper defun!


<p class="column8">
        This has the advantage of avoiding all of the nasty byte compiler
        tricks necessary to have something compiled as a function (like
        quoting with function, for example) or other things. Also, there's
        really no simple work-around for defvar. You pretty much have to
        use a defvar form. (OK, you could work around it, but it's a lot
        more work.)


<p class="column8">
        I think that if you forget about the code you've written so far (I
        know, that's difficult to do), and rewrite it using what you now
        know, you'll save yourself a lot of work and get better results.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        One important thing that you must remember when using macros is,
        that you must tell in autoload statement explicitly, that that
        defined symbol is a macro. Suppose following.

        Now user builds his package using code from library Y and X.
        Sophisticated user doesn't want to slurp whole library,

        demand by adding autoload statements into the code.

        This topic is throughly explained in the '(XEmacs lispref)
        Surprising Local Variables' and It is adviced that you read that

<p class="column8">
        One possible way to avoid this clashing is to use mangled variable
        names in local macros. Because the lisp is case sensitive, you can
        mix upper and lowercase letters to make unique variable name; the
        chance that <em class="word">body</em> would have similar name is astronomically small.
        A non-clashing name could have been made from mixing the first and

        The above is equivalent to <samp class="word">nil</samp> on non-xemacs and <samp class="word">6</samp> (or
        whatever) on emacs. The bytecompiler will compile (if nil (foo)) to
        nothing. If you used a function instead (or a variable), the
        bytecompiler would generate code to call it (fetch its value) and
        accordingly it will include both the emacs and xemacs variants of
        the code. This is slower and produces more code, however there's
        one significant shortcoming of the macro variant: code compiled
        with emacs won't work on xemacs and vice versa This makes it
        impossible to share .elc's one a site that has both emacsen

        not work to create a closure. The point of a closure is that it
        'closes' over (captures) some lexically apparent bindings. The
        exact same binding may be shared by many different closures created
        in the same lexical context. If one of the closures alters the
        value of a closed variable, all the other closures will see the
        change.


<p class="column8">
        E.g. one can use closures to implement data abstractions where the
        closed bindings essentially are state that is hidden by the
        abstraction. Here is a toy example that implements a counter with
        READ and INCREMENT methods:

<p class="column8">
        Lisp programmers use lambda functions very often, but many times it

<ul>
	<li>They can be constructed at run-time, returned from functions,
            stored in structures, etc. Not having to have a name for a
            function can sometimes be a boon, because you don't have to
            divine one for it!
<li>They can use the environment of the form they're embedded in.
            Eg they can use the local 'let' variables of the containing
            function without having to pass them as args, use dynamically
	            scoped variables, or make them globals.</li>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Real function is cleaner, easy to hand to someone, more easily
            removed from hooks, more... than a <samp class="word">lambda</samp> form.
<li>You can test functions, because you can call them. You can't
            easily test lambdas, because they have no name to call at.
	</li>
<li>You can put functions in separate file; it can be collection of
            useful functions found from the net. For speed reasons you can
            byte compile this separate file. Many lambdas in your .emacs
            just make it look messy, separate function file is more
	            convenient way.</li>

        The same <samp class="word">lambda</samp> talk applies to <samp class="word">global-set-key</samp> and <samp class="word">add-hook</samp>
        cases It's much cleaner to have function than the lambda. If you
        post the solution, people will appreciate function more than lambda

        Two obvious notes raise immediately: a) the indentation is

        If you have loaded lisp packages from the net, you probably see
        many functions that are there &quot;as is&quot;. Instead of just coding them

        update-file-autoloads will add your autoloads to loaddefs.el, and
        subsequent dumping of that file with emacs will make them a

        dumped, so simply updating it and bytecompiling it won't cause it

        Common idiom in lisp programs has been that the names contain only

        How do you know afterwards (when you just grab the code and save it
        somewhere in your .emacs or personal &quot;snippet&quot; lib) when you start
        writing code using that function, that it wasn't a Emacs
        distributed function or variable?

        code that have lot's of functions and variables starting with
        prefix <samp class="word">joe-</samp> , people get upset when they save the functions and
        notice that there is someone other's initials involved. They just
        wanted to have some general function to solve current task.

<p class="column8">
        It becomes obvious that it would be nice if everybody would use
        common naming convention, so that the code can be handed to anybody
        without changes. The best way to achieve this is that people use
        prefix:

<P>
<TABLE class="shade-normal">

<p class="column8">
        To denote <strong class="word">everything</strong> that they own: own variables own functions,
        maps.. Now it's very simple to post that code to someone else, and
        believe me everybody is happy when they receive good and clean code
        without someone else's initial involved. They feel that it's &quot;my&quot;
        code too, to solve &quot;my&quot; problems.


<p class="column8">
        To extend this naming more, people should also use convention:

<p class="column8">
        If it has anything to do with the csh-mode.el, so in general add
        the word <em class="word">my-</em> + possible <em class="word">LIB-ID</em> if you write some special
        functions for elisp packages. This way you can easily find <strong class="word">all</strong>

<p>
<p class="column8">
        There is still a matter of style with the variable naming. While it
        is possible to program like the &quot;lisp&quot; way, that may not be the
        best bet. In Emacs Lisp, variable and function names do not need to
        differ in any way, so it's perfectly legal to have same name for a
        variable and for a function and for a keymap and .. you name it.

        This is both a good and a bad idea. The good part of it is, that
        when you're working with <em class="word">MODES</em> or <em class="word">KEYMAPS</em>, it's very desirable
        to have same name, so that you know what's going on in the code.


<p class="column8">
        But in the other hand, if you're <strong class="word">not</strong> using modes, the naming
        convention is .. <em class="word">hmpf</em>, confusing. In practical terms
        it's lot more easier to look at the code if the symbol itself
        denotes the <em class="word">CLASS</em> where it belongs. If everything looks the same,
        as lisp does due to its nature, it would be welcomed if there were
        something that separate variables from function elements.

<p class="column8">
        In Tiny Tools you have seen another convention. Some has said that
        it &quot;looks ugly&quot;, &quot;I don't like it&quot;, and admittedly it can give
        that impression to the reader of the code.


<p class="column8">
        But managing lisp code gets complicated and hard to maintain if you
        don't develop some aids. A different symbol naming according to
        their CLASSES does help to read my code better and help maintainer to
        see where the variables are and where the functions are. Here is
        one possibility:

    </TR>
</TABLE>


<p class="column8">
        There is another benefit from this: it is now possible to grep all
        symbols referring to variables, and there is <em class="word">no</em> <em class="word">false</em> <em class="word">hits</em>,
        It is also posisble to run a program to do the name replacement and
        it succeeds 100%. Variables fromcan be searched from the buffer by
        give <samp class="word">my-:</samp> prefix to search engine. All in all, navigating in lisp
        code is much more easier.


<p class="column8">
        Have you ever tried to complete the lisp symbols? It's lot nicer
        when you car write <samp class="word">my-:</samp> prefix and hit <samp class="word">lisp-complete-symbol</samp>
        command to give you listing of all variables. No false hits
        concerning functions.


<p class="column8">
        Why &quot;:&quot; ? Well, that is familiar to a C++ and Perl programmer and
        The ':' character seems neutral and visible enough to be used in
        the code.


<p class="column8">
        There are also alternative choices, like using &quot;--&quot;, double dash to
        denote variables:

        In the error signaling case, (wrapper-1 nil) will cause the error

<p class="column8">
        Common Lisp loops use the Common Lisp <samp class="word">block</samp> mechanism, not the
        <samp class="word">catch</samp> mechanism. The Emacs CL package implements <samp class="word">block</samp> in terms
        of <samp class="word">catch</samp>, but there is a catch, so to speak.


<p class="column8">
        The CL package treats <samp class="word">block</samp> specially in order to optimize it.
        <samp class="word">Catch</samp> blocks are expensive at run-time, so I wanted to make sure
        the compiler could eliminate them when the body code didn't
        actually call <samp class="word">return</samp>.  (This is especially important since many
        Common Lisp constructs include implicit blocks whether you use
        those blocks or not.)


<p class="column8">
        There were technical reasons, which I don't remember exactly, why
        the optimization was best done in the compiler itself instead of in
        the <samp class="word">block</samp> macro. Therefore, the CL package has some hacks to
        modify or delay the expansion of <samp class="word">block</samp> under certain
        circumstances. But this will always be invisible unless you
        deliberately peek at the macro expansions. If you actually try
        using <samp class="word">return</samp> or <samp class="word">return-from</samp> in your code, you will find that it
        works properly.

        Note, that if you time the same functions you will get different
        absolute timings. Nevertheless, you should get same results about
        the fact that which one feels fastest. The values have been taken
        from the <em class="word">Elapsed</em> row: IT DOES NOT REPRESENT EXACT TIME SPENT in
        the function, because time spent depends on of operating system and
        current load of the Unix machine.

          including the accuracy and granularity of your system clock, and
          the overhead spent in lisp calculating and recording the
          intervals. I figure the latter is pretty constant, so while the
          times may not be entirely accurate, I think they'll give you a
          good feel for the relative amount of work spent in the various
          lisp routines you are profiling. Note further that times are
          calculated using wall-clock time, so other system load will
          affect accuracy too.</em>

        Keep in mind that some of the tests may be very stupid or

        curiosity. Please feel free to send any comments or corrections for
        the used tests cases if they are not representative enough. It is

        The elp.el is great, but don't trust the first results. Sometimes
        the timings are totally different if you clear the list and run the
        tests again. Repeat your test cases at least 3 times before you
        derive conclusions about the performance.


<p class="column8">
        In here, the <em class="word">harness</em> <em class="word">count</em> is mentioned; that means that the
        test has been repeated N times and that the most representative
        time values has been selected(usually average). Using elp, say 10
        times to repeat the test and record the timing, should give you
        solid estimate what timings are right.


<p class="column8">
        You can use the elp very easily via minor mode if you ftp lisp
        helper module: <em class="word">tinylisp.el</em>. All the tests have been
        executed with that package in the following manner:

<p class="column8">
        After the <samp class="word">tili-elp-harness</samp> function (where you can give the
        prefix how many times to repeat the test set; defualt is 3) has
        finished the elp results are shown in separate buffer from where

        Wow. using <samp class="word">append</samp> to add to the end of list is enermously slower

        append to add to the beginning of list.


<p class="column10"><em class="quote10">

<p class="column8">
        This is expected. For every call, <samp class="word">append</samp> traverses to the end of
        the list, making a copy along the way, then adds a new element at
        the end, then discards the old list. This may even lead to garbage
        collection, which can take unpredictably long.


<p class="column8">
        <samp class="word">nconc</samp> is better in that it doesn't copy the list (&quot;doesn't cons&quot;,
        which means that doesn't create new conses. Cons creation is quick
        when the new cons is taken from the free cons list, but if that is
        exhausted, memory allocation should be done). However, <samp class="word">nconc</samp>
        still traverses the list at every iteration.


<p class="column8">
        <samp class="word">cons</samp> just adds a new cell at the beginning.  <samp class="word">append</samp> and <samp class="word">nconc</samp>
        take O(n^2/2): when the list length is l they perform O(l)
        operations to traverse the list. cons has amortized cost O(1) (ie
        constant). &quot;Amortized&quot; means that it may cause memory allocation
        and/or garbage collection every once in a while, but most of the
        time it won't.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        See explanation in <a href="#let_is_using_let_slower" > (benchmarks)</A> which

<p class="column8">
        <span class="word-ref">[Vladimir]</span>


<p class="column8">
        From common sense, it wouldn't matter how you arrange your lets and
        how you init the vars, even if your function is called in a long
        loop. The function call time will still dominate the lets. If
        fc=100 and let=1, a second let will only add 1% to the overall
        time. The only time it matters is when the inner let is inside a
        loop, in which case it will probably pay to take it outside.


<p class="column8">
        We'll find that using let inside loop (defining variable j again
        and again) slightly decreases the performance. Yes, only slightly,
        because you don't normally use 1000 let statements in your
        function. This would also suggest that even if you put several let
        statements into the function, that wouldn't be be very much slower
        that using just one let statement at the beginning of file.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        I always question myself, does it make difference shere I set the
        variables value. Some times If I complex initializations I would
        like to declare variable (not set it) in let stament and leave the
        initializing after the let. This seems to indicate that using the
        let to set the variables is better.

        Use CL package's hash function which are compatible with Common

        emulate CL hashtables on GNU Emacs.

        Now, if you want to dump the hash-table anywhere, the simplest
        thing to do is dump it to a list. For example, your program
        crunches data in and out of hashtable for

<p class="column8">
        There you have all your entries in <samp class="word">alist</samp>, which you can print,
        save to file etc. All of this is, of course, much faster than if
        you had used an alist all the time, since the search time would
        have been O(n) instead of much better hashtable characteristics.

<p class="column8">
        If you had any character tests in your code, it will likely
        break in XEmacs20 and Emacs20, where a single integer does
        no longer present a charcter code. Beware especially contructs
        where you read characters directly and test the input:

<p class="column8">
        Those will fail also because you can't use old operators like <samp class="word">eq</samp>.
        In my latest 'm' library there is emulation for some of the
        following functions that are from XEmacs20's documentation. The

<p class="column8">
        t if OBJECT is a character. Unlike in FSF Emacs, a character
        is its own primitive type. Any character can be converted into
        an equivalent integer using <samp class="word">char-to-int</samp>. To convert the
        other way, use <samp class="word">int-to-char</samp>; however, only some integers can
        be converted into characters. Such an integer is called a
        <samp class="word">char-to-int</samp>; see <samp class="word">char-int-p</samp>.


<p class="column8">
        Some functions that work on integers (e.g. the comparison
        functions &lt;, &lt;=, =, /=, etc. and the arithmetic functions +, -,
        *, etc.)  accept characters and implicitly convert them into
        integers. In general, functions that work on characters also
        accept char-ints and implicitly convert them into characters.
        WARNING: Neither of these behaviors is very desirable, and they
        are maintained for backward compatibility with old E-Lisp
        programs that confounded characters and integers willy-nilly.
        These behaviors may change in the future; therefore, do not
        rely on them. Instead, use the character-specific functions
        such as <samp class="word">char=</samp>.
