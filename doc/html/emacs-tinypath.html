            This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
            please see "t2html.pl --help" for option --script-file
            to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

            XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
            It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
            element and attribute names

            This default CSS2 has been validated according to
            http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

            Comments on the CSS tags:

            -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

            NETSCAPE 4.05

            -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
               font size changes does not show up in screen.
            -  :hover property is not recognised

            NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

            -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
               (IE has no trouble to show it)

            MSIE 4.0+

            - Renders CSS very well.

            Media types

            - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
              the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
              or media "screen"
            - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
              to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
              just define P.column7 { ... }

            The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
            I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

            So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
            (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
            which means both print and scree types.)

                @media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

            To work around that, we separate the definitions with

                P.code { .. }               // For screen

                @media print { P.code      // for printer
                {
                    ..
                }}

            And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

        When you have set up your Emacs installation to your liking, a day
        comes when you decide that it's time to seriously reconsider the
        directory structure of your installed lisp packages. At start, it
        is customary to use simple file hierarchy where all private
        packages are installed under:
  
<P>
<TABLE  class="shade-normal"
        width="94%"
        border="0"

        >
    <TR>
    <TD class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <PRE>      ~/elisp   ;; some people also prefer ~/lisp
    </TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>
  

<P class="column8">
        Complete kits are usually installed directly under the root:
  
<P>
<TABLE  class="shade-normal"
        width="94%"
        border="0"
        cellpadding="10"

      ~/elisp/packages/pcl-cvs-2.9.2/
    </TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>
  

<P class="column8">
        A more sophisticated way is to use symlinks to the latest
        versions, so that you don't have to change <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> every
        time you install a new version. It is only matter of updating
        the symlink:

        In networked, where Windows ic oupled with Unix workstations via SAMBA,
        you may have mapped the <STRONG class="word">H:</STRONG> disk to you Unix <STRONG class="word">$HOME</STRONG>:

</TABLE>
  

<P class="column8">
        Now, there is a catch when you use Unix symlinks in <SAMP class="word">$HOME/elisp</SAMP>
        and try to access the directories from Windows. Having set PC's
        HOME environment variable to point to H:, Emacs can start reading
        Unix <SAMP class="word">$HOME/.emacs</SAMP> startup file, but you soon see simple
        error messages like &quot;Can't load library xxx&quot;, which soon follow by
        bigger concerns: &quot;autoloading xxx failed&quot;. The problem is the
        mounted H: disk. You see, PC's network mount can't distinguish
        symlinked directories from real directories, so all symlinked Unix
        directories in <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> are dead. And that's why most of the
        files cannot be found any more.
  

<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       The conclusions</STRONG></EM>

  

<P class="column8">
        For cross platform solution it is best not to rely on symlinks,
        because they don't work over a Windows mount. Secondly,
        updating <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> should not be needed by hand after a new
        package installation, after a directory name change, after
        directory structure change, etc. A dream package would solve this
        all and do the hard work: &quot;There, that is the root(s) of all Emacs
        lisp, go and sniff all the directories and update <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>&quot;
  

<P class="column8">
        That was what this package originally was all about. Nowadays it
        does a little more than that. Your <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> is updated
        automatically without any manual work. You only have to give the
        start ROOT path(s) of your installed lisp hierarchies in the file
        system. This package is highly effective: scanning thousands of
        files in a matter of seconds and once the cache has been created,
        it takes only a snap to load it in next sessions. All <SAMP class="word">require</SAMP> and
        <SAMP class="word">load</SAMP> commands execute also faster than previously, because the
        information about existing files is immediately available. The
        speedup is helped through advised functions.

<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       Automatic load-path configuration</STRONG></EM>

  
<UL>
	<LI>Define list of <SAMP class="word">root</SAMP> directories of your Emacs lisp and this
            package will recursively add directories which contain .el or
            .elc files to <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>
	<LI>A cache is utilized to remember previous scan and
            expired periodically. Using cache speeds up loading files
            considerably if you have many directories. The number of lisp
            directories doesn't affect the load performance any more.
            This is accomplished by using extra advice code in functions:
            <SAMP class="word">load</SAMP>, <SAMP class="word">load-library</SAMP>, <SAMP class="word">require</SAMP>, <SAMP class="word">locate-library</SAMP> and
            <SAMP class="word">autoload</SAMP>.
	<LI>When Emacs becomes idle (some 15 minutes of idle time) the
            cache and <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> is validated for erroneous entries and
            rebuilt as needed. This feature should auto-detect changes in
            directory structure automatically and help semi auto-installing
            new directories (packages) for you.
	<LI>The <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> is optimized so, that users' files automatically
            take precedence first (~/elisp), next any other files found,
            and last the core Emacs files in the distribution.
            For example in previous Emacs versions, shipped
            speedbar.el used to be too outdated if used with JDE
            package. It had to be manually updated from the
            development site. That us the reason why core Emacs paths
	            are at the then of <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>.
</UL>


  

<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       Automatic Info-default-directory-list configuration</STRONG></EM>

  
<UL>
	<LI>If you download packages that include Emacs info files,
            the <SAMP class="word">Info-default-directory-list</SAMP> is updated at the same time
            as the <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>, when root directories are examined.
	<LI>No more manual updating of info files. The missing
            <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP> entry is created or updated as needed.
	<LI>You can update all <STRONG class="word">new</STRONG> info files in your system by calling
	            M-x <SAMP class="word">tinypath-info-scan-Info-default-directory-list</SAMP>
</UL>


  

<P class="column8">
        If you have added new info files by hand, just call function
        <SAMP class="word">tinypath-info-handler</SAMP> to update your Emacs and update the
        <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP> entry. After that reset infor with <SAMP class="word">M-x</SAMP>
        <SAMP class="word">tinypath-info-initialize</SAMP>
  

<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       Win32 automatic manpath configuration</STRONG></EM>

  
<UL>
	<LI>In Unix systems the MANPATH enavironment variable contains
            directories where to find manual pages, but in Win32,
            there is no default MANPATH and <SAMP class="word">M-x</SAMP> <SAMP class="word">man</SAMP> does not work.
	<LI>If package <EM class="word">woman.el</EM> (Included in latest Emacs
            versions) is along <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>, it is automatically
            configured to support to read manual pages. It replaces
	            the <SAMP class="word">M-x</SAMP> <SAMP class="word">man</SAMP> command.

<UL>
	<LI>If <EM class="word">cygwin1.dll</EM> (&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">http://www.cygwin.com/</A>&gt;) is in your path,
            automatic detection tries to find the Cygwin root and scan

        The <SAMP class="word">tinypath-:load-hook</SAMP> contains function <SAMP class="word">tinypath-setup</SAMP> which
        starts examining all directories under <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> and
        <SAMP class="word">tinypath-:load-path-root</SAMP> which is set to reasonable defaults of
        site wide and personal installations. If you keep all your lisp
        files under <EM class="word">$HOME/elisp</EM>, then you do not need to configure anything
        for this package to work. Your <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> has been updated after
        this statement at the beginning of your <EM class="word">$HOME/.emacs</EM>

        there is a problem, because Emacs distribution also includes Gnus.
        There is NO WAY TO TELL OR CHANGE path order when the cache is in
        use. This is a design decision and cannot be changed. The old trick,
        where a new directory was added in front of <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>, will not
        work because everything goes through cache. What you need to do

<P class="column8">
        In Unix environment, it is also common that several hosts are NFS
        mounted so that your home disk is available from every server. The
        available programs are not usually NFS mounted, but programs are
        stored locally on each server's own disk. Now, there would be a
        problem if you logged to host <EM class="word">A</EM> and started tinypath.el which had
        made cache in on host <EM class="word">B</EM>, because <EM class="word">A</EM> does not have the same
        directories as <EM class="word">B</EM> did (site-lisp). This has been taken care of by
        including <STRONG class="word">hostname</STRONG> part in the cache file name. For each host, a
        separate cache file is created. Now, suppose all the Unix hosts are
        same brand, say Sun OS, Linux, or HP-UX and a good administrator has
        separated the programs and the data in their own directory
        structures. Furthermore, these structures are NFS mounted and thus
        visible to the remote machines. In this scenario, it would not
        really matter to which host you log into, because you would always
        see the same programs and site-lisp directories and there would not
        be need for host specific cache files. In that case, disable the
        <EM class="word">HOST</EM> word by setting this variable to nil:

        In addition to updating the <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP>, the recursive function
        has a chance to search for installed info files as well. When you

        One possibility is that after you download and uncompress a

        (Never mind that in Unix you might use Makefile to install
        everything, in Win32 it's all manual work). This package does the
        same job by looking for directories that either have info files or
        a central info repository called <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP>. If the <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP> file
        has all the info files up to date, nothing is done. In other cases:
  
<UL>
	<LI>If the central <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP> in the directory does not exits,
            it is created.
	<LI>If <SAMP class="word">dir</SAMP> does not contain entry for info file, it is added.

<P class="column8">
        The <SAMP class="word">Info-default-directory-list</SAMP> is updated to include any new

        maintenance friendly. No need to worry about supplied info files any
        more, they are automatically integrated to your Emacs. If you have
        installed any new packages to your system, Emacs packages or Unix
        packages that installed something with &quot;install -c&quot;, it is best to
        update your info files with <SAMP class="word">M-x</SAMP>

        which can traverse directory hierarchies to find relevant
        directories for the setup. This interface is automatically used

        use Cygwin similarly as the big brother Linux. Let's suppose that
        you have dedicated a disk portion where you intend to duplicate

        The purpose of compression support is to make it possible to

        There is no denying it, this package is dangerous. When something

        might want to try to rescue the situation or understand what is
        going on. The most usual blame is the <EM class="word">cache</EM> content which does not

        Because this package is among the first that is loaded from Emacs
        startup file, It contains copies of some functions from TinyLib;
       libraries, to make the package independent until the point where
        the <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> has been set up and other libraries are available.
        In the code you may find marks &quot;#copy:&quot; which indicate code that
        has been copied/simplified to be used here. Autoloads statements in
        this package defer loading functions until the end is reached and

        packages there are different &quot;installations&quot;. Gnus is one
        interesting example: Every Emacs and XEmacs release comes with
        Gnus version, which is usually outdated and many install Gnus
        privately. The problem is multiple Gnus versions in the load
        paths and the wished situation is that there would be only the
        latest. there is experimental code to find out which of the
        Gnus packages along <SAMP class="word">load-path</SAMP> is the latest and after making
        hopefully right decision (according to gnus-version-*
        variable) the other Gnus locations are hidden by modifying

        Same timing test as above, but now using compiled cache file at
        Emacs startup. In this case <SAMP class="word">tinypath-:cache-file-postfix</SAMP> value was
        '.elc'. The speedup is 50%, rducing the load time to mere 3-4
        seconds. Notice the dramatic change in <SAMP class="word">tinypath-cache-file-load</SAMP>:
        0.5 seconds vs. 2.5 seconds non-compiled.
