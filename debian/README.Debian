Hi there. Here is a quickstart to use the tiny-path:

1) Create ~/elisp and put your personal .el stuff there;

2) Add to your .emacs the following line:

   (require 'tinypath)

3) Enjoy. 

If you prefer another directory than the default ~/elisp, replace 2) by:

   (debian-tinypath "/wherever/your/el/files/are/located")

More documentation in /usr/share/doc/emacs-tiny-tools.
