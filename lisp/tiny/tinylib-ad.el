;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, 1999
;;
;;      This is lisp function library, package itself does nothing.
;;      It modifies existing Emacs functions with advice.el in order
;;      to provide backward compatibility for functions that have changed.
;;      E.g. Emacs 20.4 introduced new parameter NOERR to `require' command.
;;
;;      There is another way, load this library first and continue using
;;      your current Emacs version. This package will redefine functions
;;      only when needed, so it should be quite safe.
;;
;;  Usage
;;
;;      You must not autoload this package; but always include
;;
;;          (require 'tinylibm)
;;
;;      You don't need any other require commands: all other library
;;      functions get defined as well by using autoload. Repeat: you don't
;;      have to put these in your packages:
;;
;;          (require 'tinylib)     ;; leave this out
;;          (require 'tinyliby)    ;; not needed either.
;;          (require 'tinylib-ad)  ;; not needed either.
