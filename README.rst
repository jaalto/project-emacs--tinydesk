Description
===========

This project contains an `Emacs`_ package that helps saving and
restoring list of open files and directories.

E.g if you want to keep certain files to a "project", you can restore
or combine any one of the these saved states into current Emacs.
Likewise, you can **unload** list of files, i.e. projects, from Emacs.

See documentation at the beginning of ``*.el`` file for further
information.

Epackage
========

This repository is part of the `Epackages network`_. The epackages are
pre-formatted software packages for `Emacs`_ that provide easy way to
install more features to Emacs. Similar to concept of Windows MSI or
RedHat Linux *.rpm and `Debian`_ *.deb packages.

See `DELPS`_, Distributed Emacs Lisp Packages, for more
information.
