Description
===========

This project contains an `Emacs`_ package that helps saving and
restoring list of open files and directories.

E.g if you want to hae different kind of editing sessions, you can
restore or combine any one of the them into current Emacs. Likewise,
you can **unload** list of files from Emacs.

See documentation at the beginning of ``*.el`` file for further information.

Epackage
========

This repository is part of the `Epackages network`_. The epackages are
pre-formatted software packages for `Emacs`_ that provide easy way to
install more features to Emacs. Similar to concept of Windows MSI or
RedHat Linux *.rpm and `Debian`_ *.deb packages.

See `DELPS`_, Distributed Emacs Lisp Packages, for more
information.
